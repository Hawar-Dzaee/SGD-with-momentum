# SGD-with-momentum
Visualizing why SGD with momentum converges faster than Vanilla SGD

Plotting (plain SGD) and (SGD with momentum) in the loss function Landscape, provides us with the intuition why SGD with momentum converges faster. 
we are also aiming to show why in overshooting when using SGD with moment won't be a problem (actually it will help us to escape local minimas).
