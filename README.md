# SGD-with-momentum

Visualizing why SGD with momentum converges faster than Vanilla SGD

ðŸ›‘ Please make sure to open the notebook in Google Colab for Plotly's graphs to render.

Plotting (plain SGD) and (SGD with momentum) in the loss function landscape provides us with the intuition why SGD with momentum converges faster. We are also aiming to show why overshooting when using SGD with momentum won't be a problem (in fact, it will help us escape local minima).



1- plotting Loss function with initial parameters, and Global minima. 
out task is to go from green point to the green point
